# MCWR
### THIS IS NOT FINISHED
MCWR is a minecraft server manager written in rust. It aims to have:
- Simplicity
- Quick creation of new Vanilla, Paper/Spigot, and other servers
- Support for BungeeCord
- Support for multiple worlds

This server manager is meant to be very minimal. This is **not** meant to eliminate manually editing server config files or plugins, it is simply to prevent you from having to type the same commands so often when creating or managing servers.

## Disclaimers
I wrote this primarily to learn rust, I am happy to take feedback and suggestions but ***EXPECT ISSUES***
